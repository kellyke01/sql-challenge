in this challenge I was able to show a relationship diagram 
between the six different tables in order to be able to have a visual of how they are alike.

I was then able to import those six data sets into PostgreSQL in order to figure out the
primary keys, foreign keys, integers and ect.

I was able to take those initial data engineering pieces and accurately answer each question in the 
data analysis.
 I was able to lean on the additional videos provided by Dr. A to find my way through this module challenge.
